# Litter Robot Monitor

A Python script that monitors Litter-Robot activity and sends automated alerts for anomalies via email and Slack. It tracks daily litter box usage, pet weight changes, and waste levels, sending notifications when usage is too high/low, weights are outside healthy ranges, or the waste drawer needs emptying. The script is run via a cron job for daily data collection and CSV logging. Perfect for automated pet health monitoring and maintenance reminders.
